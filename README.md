# Statistics Client Library

The Statistics Client Library is a Node.js wrapper for the [Statistics API](https://developer.genesyscloud.com/api/reference/statistics/) that makes it easier to code against the API. The library provides much of the supporting code needed to make HTTP requests, process HTTP responses, and enable [CometD](https://cometd.org/) messaging.

The library is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/GenesysPureEngage/statistics-client-js) and Genesys welcomes pull requests for corrections.

## Install

Genesys recommends that you install the Statistics Client Library for Node.js with [NPM](https://npmjs.org/). Run the following command to install the library:

~~~
npm i genesys-statistics-client-js
~~~
